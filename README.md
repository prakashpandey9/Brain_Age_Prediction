# Brain Age Prediction
## Prediction of Brain Age using Convolutional Neural Networks


* This Project aims to predict the brain tissue age of a person using his/her MRI scan.
* We implemented a 3D convolutional Neural Network in Keras which was trained over T1 weighted MRI scan of around 1500 healthy person.
* The difference of brain age and chronological can be used to detect the presence of a mental disorder if there is any such deformity.

## Installation
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Nibabel
* Keras
* Scikit-learn
* Scipy


###### This project is still under development. We are trying to reduce the mean absolute error between actual age and predicted age of a healthy person.
